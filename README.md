# social connect app
Here's how to connect your app to discord. 

Prerequisites: 
1. A discord bot, which needs to be present in each concerned guild.
2. An independently running server to make the discord api calls from (discord api calls from the frontend except oauth2 ones fail over CORS issues
3. A config.js file to read your client_id and client_secret from, if and when necessary

That's all! Do write to me if you get stuck. I know the documentation on the official site is terrible. :)
